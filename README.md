Make your apps smaller by adding post build compression to your `create-react-app` build without configuration.

Compresses all html, css and javascript files in the build folder using brotli and gzip algorithms.

Feel free to create an issue for any problems you've had or if you want to request a new feature.

## Usage

##### 0) Create your app using create-react-app

#### 1) Installation

Install the package as a dev dependency:

```bash
npm install @xzar90/compress-create-react-app --save-dev
```

#### 2) Usage

Edit your app's build script in `package.json`:

```diff
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
-   "build": "react-scripts build",
+   "build": "react-scripts build && compress-cra",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  }
```

###### Custom build directory

Since version `1.1.0`, you can optionally provide a path to your build directory by adding `-d` or `--directory` argument to the command in your `package.json`:

```bash
...
"build": "react-scripts build && compress-cra -d /path/to/build",
...
```

The default build path is `/build`. The provided custom path should be a relative path from your project's **root directory**.

###### Custom configuration

Since version `1.1.7` place `compress-cra.json` in your app root directory.

```json
{
  "algorithms": ["br", "gz"],
  "filetypes": [
    ".html",
    ".js",
    ".css",
    ".svg",
    ".png",
    ".jpg",
    ".mp3",
    ".wav",
    ".tff",
    ".woff2",
    ".map"
  ],
  "directory": "/build"
}
```

Since version `1.1.8`, you can optionally provide a path to a config file by adding `-c` or `--config` argument to the command in your `package.json`:

```bash
...
"build": "react-scripts build && compress-cra -c /path/to/configfile",
...
```

The default is `compress-cra.json`.

#### 3) Build your app just like you normally would

```bash
npm run build
```

#### 4) Make your server serve the compressed files

The way to set up your server highly depends on the server you use.
